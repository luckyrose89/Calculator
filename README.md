# Calculator
A calculator made with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap

This is a pure JavaScript calculator that accepts mouse led input and evaluates it to return results.
The calculator features the '+', '-', 'X' & '/' operations along with a few functionalities. These functionalities
include an enter button '=' to evaluate input, a del button to delete the last entered input and a a 'c' button 
to clear the screen.

This version of calculator does not allow for keyboard input. When I finished the project, I already wanted to update its
javascript file. In future versions, I want the project to be MVC based and to use a DRY approach to coding. There will also be
acceptance of keyboard input by the application. This calculator was coded as part of freecodecamp's advanced project section.
